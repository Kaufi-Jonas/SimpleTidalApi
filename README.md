# TidalLib
Unofficial C# API for TIDAL music streaming service. I overhauled [Yaronzz](https://github.com/yaronzz) implementation, but for the moment I only left the features I require, meaning you can only perform searches.

## Installation
You have to build this project by yourself.

## Implementation Notes
The necessary data for authentication is read from TIDAL desktop client's log file in AppData.
