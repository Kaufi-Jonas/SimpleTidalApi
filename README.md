# TidalLib
Unofficial, simple C# API for TIDAL music streaming service. I overhauled  [yaronzz/TidalLib](https://github.com/yaronzz/TidalLib), but for the moment, I only left the features I require, meaning you can only work with the information you retrieve through search queries.

## Installation
You can find this project on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimpleTidalApi).

## Implementation Notes
The necessary key for authentication is read from the TIDAL desktop client's log file in AppData.
